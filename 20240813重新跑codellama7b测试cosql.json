To answer your question, the friend ID of 1689 is not a valid ID in the Friend table.\n\nThe Friend table has a column named `student_id` which contains the IDs of the students who are friends with each other. The `friend_id` column in the Friend table contains the IDs of the students who are friends with the student whose ID is in the `student_id` column.\n\nTherefore, to find the friend ID of a student with ID 1689, you would need to look in the Friend table for a row where the `student_id` column has a value of 1689. The `friend_id` column in that row would contain the ID of the student who is a friend of the student with ID 1689.\n\nI hope this clears up any confusion. Please let me know if you have any further questions."}]},
